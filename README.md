## Device & Entities

The integration creates a single device: **Maybank Gold & Silver Prices**

All entities are grouped under this device for easy management:
- `sensor.gold_buy_price` - Gold buying price (MYR/g)
- `sensor.gold_sell_price` - Gold selling price (MYR/g)
- `sensor.silver_buy_price` - Silver buying price (MYR/g)
- `sensor.silver_sell_price` - Silver selling price (MYR/g)

All values are in MYR per gram. Attributes include the data source URL and last update status.

## Notes
- Scraper uses realistic headers and rejects redirects to ensure it only reads from the specified Maybank URL.
- If the siteâ€™s markup changes or anti-bot protection blocks your HA host, the integration will log clear errors.
