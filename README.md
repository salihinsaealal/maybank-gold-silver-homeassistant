Home Assistant custom integration that provides Gold and Silver Buy/Sell prices (including Islamic MIGA-i) scraped directly from Maybank Malaysia's public rates page:

https://www.maybank2u.com.my/maybank2u/malaysia/en/personal/rates/gold_and_silver.page

## Features

- ✅ **No API keys required** - Direct scraping from public Maybank page
- ✅ **UI-based setup** - No YAML configuration needed
- ✅ **8 sensors** - Regular Gold/Silver + Islamic MIGA-i accounts
- ✅ **2 device cards** - Separate cards for better organization
- ✅ **Auto-updates** - Every 30 minutes
- ✅ **Intuitive icons** - Podium medals and gold icons
- ✅ **HACS compatible** - Easy installation and updates

## Installation

### Via HACS (Custom Repository)
1. Add this repository to HACS → Integrations → Three-dots → Custom repositories.
2. Category: Integration. Add.
3. Find "Maybank Gold & Silver" in HACS and install.
4. Restart Home Assistant.
5. Go to Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → "Maybank Gold & Silver".

### Manual
1. Copy `custom_components/maybank_gold_silver/` into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Add the integration from Settings → Devices & Services.
## Devices & Entities

The integration creates **2 separate device cards** for better organization:

### Device 1: Maybank Islamic Gold (MIGA-i) 🟡
- Buy (≥100g) - Islamic gold buy price for 100g and above (MYR/g)
- Sell (≥100g) - Islamic gold sell price for 100g and above (MYR/g)
- Buy (<100g) - Islamic gold buy price for below 100g (MYR/g)
- Sell (<100g) - Islamic gold sell price for below 100g (MYR/g)

### Device 2: Maybank Gold & Silver 🥇🥈
- Gold Buy Price - Regular gold buying price (MYR/g)
- Gold Sell Price - Regular gold selling price (MYR/g)
- Silver Buy Price - Silver buying price (MYR/g)
- Silver Sell Price - Silver selling price (MYR/g)

**Total: 8 sensors across 2 devices** - All values are in MYR per gram. Each sensor includes attributes with data source URL, last update status, and error information.

## Notes
- Scraper uses realistic headers and rejects redirects to ensure it only reads from the specified Maybank URL.
- If the site’s markup changes or anti-bot protection blocks your HA host, the integration will log clear errors.
